# Anticor

Python implementation of the anticor algorithm originally published by Borodin, A., El-Yaniv, R., and Gogan, V. (2004). Can We Learn to Beat the Best Stock. Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research 21, 579-594.  For more details, please visit [T6Labs](https://www.t6labs.com).

# KACM and W-KACM

Based on the AC algorithm, two new algorithms have been proposed. For more details, please visit [my notes](https://github.com/CatQuantum/Anticor-to-WKACM/blob/master/From%20AC%20to%20WKACM.md) or the flowing papers.
